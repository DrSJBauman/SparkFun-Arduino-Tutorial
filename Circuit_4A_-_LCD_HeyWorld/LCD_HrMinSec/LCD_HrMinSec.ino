SparkFun Inventorâ€™s Kit
Circuit 4A-HelloWorld

The LCD will display the words "Hello World" and show how many seconds have passed since
the RedBoard was last reset.

This sketch was written by SparkFun Electronics, with lots of help from the Arduino community.
This code is completely free for any use.
